          "Venus is often referred to as Earth's twin due to its similar size and composition. However, its thick atmosphere, composed primarily of carbon dioxide, traps heat, making it the hottest planet in our solar system. This greenhouse effect has created a hostile environment with temperatures hot enough to melt lead. Venus is also shrouded in a thick layer of sulfuric acid clouds, which reflect sunlight and give it a yellowish appearance.",

          "Mars, often called the Red Planet due to its reddish hue caused by iron oxide, is a cold, rocky world with a thin atmosphere. It has polar ice caps, ancient riverbeds, and evidence of past volcanic activity, suggesting that it once had a warmer, wetter climate. Mars is a prime target for exploration due to its potential for past or present life, and NASA's Perseverance rover is currently searching for signs of ancient microbial life on the planet's surface.",
